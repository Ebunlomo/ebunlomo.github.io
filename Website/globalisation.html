    			<p>The word globalisation has existed since the 1960s and is a buzz word that many people use to describe everything that is going on in the world today. This broad understanding of globalisation renders the term meaningless and gives rise to substantial disagreements amongst scholars as to what the term actually means. In many ways it is a phenomenon not easily captured in a sentence and one that is hard to define. A quick google search churns out a variety of meanings for the term globalisation.
    			</p>
	<p>   			
	   In economics online, it defines globalisation as the integration of markets in the global economy, leading to the increased interconnectedness of national economies.
	</p>
		<p>
		  This economic view of globalisation is supported by the business dictionary which states that globalisation is the worldwide movement toward economic, financial, trade, and communications integration. Globalization implies the opening of local and nationalistic perspectives to a broader outlook of an interconnected and interdependent world with free transfer of capital, goods, and services across national frontiers. 
		</p>
		
			<p>
				In contrast the Financial Times Lexicon takes a deeper meaning looking at how globalisation effects everything as whole. It describes globalisation as a process by which national and regional economies, societies, and cultures have become integrated through the global network of trade, communication, immigration and transportation. In this way it doesn&#8217t just focus on the economy but different aspects of day to day life.
             </p>

				<p> 
					Others see globalisation as a set of images. The term takes its inspiration from the fall of the Berlin Wall; the illusion that barriers to cross-national economic relations were falling. For friend and foe alike, the ideological framework of globalization is liberalism - arguments for free trade and free movement of capital. The imagery of globalization also derives from the World Wide Web, the idea that the web-like connectivity of every site to every other site represents a model for all forms of global communication. 
				</p>

					<p>
						Two key things stand clear in these definitions; globalisation as a process towards a future goal and interconnection. </p>

						<p> During our research, we found that those in favour of globalisation and those against globalisation had stark differences in how they defined and saw the term. Those who are in favour of globalisation see it as positive thing that could increase the global economy and lift people out of poverty. They also saw it as a process of mutual impact and influence between and amongst nation-states. Those who are against it see globalisation as an erosion of nationalism and for many African countries it&#8217s just another word for colonisation. As African countries are continuously being shaped, influenced and defined by happenings in the West </div>

    		<h4><strong>Globalisation: It&#8217s meaning to African Countries</strong></h4>
    		<div class="panel-body">
    		<p>Despite the heading of this section of the website, we do not presume to know exactly how every country in Africa feels about globalisation. But through informed academic reading we will endeavour to critically discuss how globalisation affects Nigeria. 

    		
<p>There&#8217s a consensus amongst many African nations that globalization is a mere rebranding of economic, political, social and cultural imperialism.  Standing back and looking at globalisation as whole, there is weight to this view. It is clear that it has largely been driven by the interests and needs of the developed world (Grieco and Holmes, 1999). Take for example the many different native languages in Nigeria. These languages are at risk to extinction as a result of unfounded weight placed on European languages such as English and French. This is because in the global political and legal sphere this is the language used to make decisions that influence international laws and politics.</p>


<p>
Language is just one way in which the world is coming together. There is a gradual move towards uniformity, especially as it increases the ease in which businesses can operate, the ease in which individuals can travel and the possibility of discovering knew things to help in the advancement of humans. Consequently, there is a serious concern that nations like Nigeria whose contributions to the global economy is low may lose their identity.
The marginalization of Africa in global trade has been well captured by many scholars. Gibson notes that, &#145the (post) industrialized North increasingly trades exclusively with itself. African urban areas though growing in population, lack the capacity and infrastructure to compete economically and have become completely marginalized. By 1996 Africa&#8217s proportion of world&#8217s exports had dropped from a minuscule 2.4% in 1980 to an irrelevant 1%. Take away South Africa and the oil producing states, the percentage is next to nothing.  
</p

<div>
This means that many Western countries are dismissive of the value of Africa. One French Diplomat said that: &#147Economically speaking, if the entire black Africa, with the exception of South Africa, were to disappear in a flood, the global cataclysm will be approximately non-existent.&#148 This dismissiveness and marginalisation of Africa is further seen in the way Africa is represented; one nation filled with poverty and corruption. Despite the fact that Africa is a continent filled with different and diverse cultures and languages and wealth.  
As such, globalisation doesn&#8217t seem like the liberalisation that it promises to be but it seems like an entrapment and the marginalisation of many African nations.
