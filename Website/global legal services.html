        <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>Global Legal Services: What does that mean?</strong></h3>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
        <p>The term global legal services can be split into two parts; globalisation and legal services. The meaning of globalisation has already been dealt with. See &#145what is globalisation&#146 for a detailed explanation of the term. </p>
        <p>Legal services is the work carried out by lawyers. These include but are not limited to advice, drafting wills and representing clients in court.</p>
        <p>Global legal services means the provision of legal services by lawyers to clients located outside of their national jurisdictions and sometimes, without being physically present within the foreign jurisdiction.  Furthermore, it also refers to being able to qualify and train as a lawyer in a jurisdiction outside their own. </p>
        <p>The most common form of globalized legal practice is a firm establishing an office branch in a foreign country. For example, a law firm headquartered in New York could operate a branch or representative office in London for the provision of legal services within the United Kingdom. This type of global legal services is common amongst big law firms such as Jones Day, Lathan & Watkins and Allen & Overy. It is also common for legal practice to outsource briefs to lawyers offshore which allows lawyers in particular local jurisdictions to address critical legal issues based on the applicable local laws. This enables lots of law firms to engage in international work without ever leaving their home state. </p>
        <p>The IBA Report shows that: (a) 56 per cent of jurisdictions now allow partnership or association between foreign and domestic lawyers; (b) 77 per cent do not impose a nationality restriction on foreign lawyers requalifying as local lawyers; (c) In 47 per cent of jurisdictions, foreign law firms are present facilitating cross-border trade and investment; (d) That practice in other jurisdictions is by no means the preserve of traditional &#145international&#146 law firms. &#145Independent&#146 regional practices in places such as Central Asia and South America, linguistic collaborations between Portuguese speaking Africa, Brazil and Portugal, and foreign offices of Chinese, Korean and Japanese firms, are now commonplace; (e) That in 80 per cent of countries covered in the report, foreign firms are now permitted to open offices (although often with restrictions); 35 per cent of countries foreign firms may now employ local lawyers; and in 80 per cent of the countries covered local firms may now employ foreign lawyers; (f) That in Egypt, Morocco and Algeria, foreign law firms operate branch offices independently or in association with local law firms.</p>
        <p>In addition, legal services are becoming more globalised due to the internet. It has made it possible for a wealth of legal knowledge and advice to be made available to anyone from any part of the world. As Horton said &#145the largest benefit technology has had for lawyers is the one that is taken the most for granted: faster access to knowledge bases &#151 whether that be in terms of legislation, case law or internal firm knowledge.&#146  This is clearly seen in the huge amounts of data available over the internet. A quick google search allows individuals to learn more about laws in different countries. Unfortunately the laws of most if not all countries have been unable to develop suitable safeguards to prevent this. Therefore we are seeing legal services being offered by a variety of people from a variety of jurisdictions, which sometimes undermines the home state&#8217s lawyers&#8217 ability to provide legal services. </p>
        <p>Another place where we see services being liberalised from focusing within their home state is in the European Union. Here, substantial laws and case law have grown showing the limits and extents of global legal services. There are four main directives that lawyers and potential lawyers can use and there are; The Lawyer&#8217s Establishment Directive (Directive 98/5), The Lawyers Services Directive (Directive 77/249), Professional Qualifications (Directive 2005/36) and Services Directive (Directive 2006/123). </p>

        <div>
          <h3><strong>Global Legal Services and its effect on Nigeria</strong></h3>
          <p>The legal position in Nigeria is that no foreign lawyer can engage directly in any form of legal practice in Nigeria. This is a reserved activity/profession for only those who have been called to the bar. Furthermore, Nigeria has made no specific commitments to the WTO on legal services. The imposition of these restrictions leave only one option; any foreign lawyer or law firm can only engage a Nigerian lawyer to provide services as local counsel in respect of specific legal works. The advantage of this to Nigeria is that the legal profession would remain reserved and therefore would not be influenced by the West. It also ensures that Nigerian lawyers are the best equipped to apply their knowledge of local law and regulations in dealing with the issues entrusted to them. However, these restrictions slow down the progress of global legal services and in turn prevents Nigeria from being a hub of legal activity and expertise.  </p>
          <p>Another way in which the globalisation of legal services has been hindered in Nigeria is the considerably poor investment by the state in the development of information communication technology. Technology has had a massive impact in the development of law and the way it is delivered. This is clearly seen in the huge amounts of data available over the internet. A quick google search is becoming increasingly accurate, and helpful for the rising litigants in person, for those who want to cut back on legal costs and for those who want to learn more about law in foreign jurisdictions. Law firms in the West are capitalising on using technology to enhance their provisions of legal services. A recent example of this is Bird & Bird who have created a Virtual General Counsel. This allows clients from different jurisdictions to use a video link, phone line or email to receive advice on specific legal issues by the right person.  Therefore Nigeria&#8217s limited access to internet service and the unpredictably poor quality of existing internet services have impacted negatively on the capacities of home lawyers to participate in the global legal market. If Nigeria is unable to invest more in internet technology it could be left behind and undermined by other lawyers who are able to utilize these tools. </p>
          <p>Globalisation has also oversaturated the legal market. Global economic conditions, such as the financial crisis of 2008, has adversely effected the budgets of businesses as well as clients, leading to a shift in their &#147buying habits&#148. Driven by pressure to cut down costs and increase efficiency in response to the recent economic recession, there has been an inclination by corporate clients towards reduction of outsourcing of legal work and the uptake of in-house Counsel. This shrinking demand for lawyers coupled with the increasing supply has led to a saturated market. Lawyers Reports indicate that at the end of October 2015, 3,600 lawyers were called to the Nigerian Bar.  This many new lawyers has meant that many of them are under-employed because of an intense competitive legal market, both in terms of clientele globally, and also in terms of employment within the legal profession in Nigeria.</p>
          <p> Lastly, there is a perception of Nigeria, and indeed most African nations, that they are corrupt and it&#8217s this perception and stigma that international law firms do not want to have attached to them. Therefore, it&#8217s a possibility that as the world becomes increasingly globalised Nigeria and African nations alike would be left behind to pick up the crumbs of legal work. </p>
          <p><strong>Is globalisation of legal services in Nigeria a bad thing? </strong> The answer depends upon your stance on globalisation. If you&#8217re a proponent for globalisation then the breaking down of barriers so that lawyers can train, qualify and establish themselves outside their own jurisdiction would be welcomed. However, if you&#8217re opposed to the idea of globalisation, then this could seem like a terrible idea.</p>

      <h3><strong>The Future?</strong></h3>
      <p>It&#8217s uncertain. The recent Brexit vote reveals the rejection of globalisation and all that it brings. Although many people opposed to globalisation are of the idea that it&#8217s a one way street, it&#8217s clear, within Europe at least, that cultures, knowledge and more are being exchanged to a fast degree. </p>
      <p><strong>Is globalisation inevitable and by default global legal services?</strong>Only time can tell</p>
      <p><strong>What should Nigeria do? </strong>There are two option for Nigeria;
      <ol>
        <li> The first is to embrace the globalisation of legal services with open arms. This is because if Nigeria doesn&#8217t they could be completely left behind and their legal services could end up being sub-par to others.</li>
        <li> The second is to keep Nigeria&#8217s legal services doors closed, and reinvent and improve the services they do offer so that once they open the door they are on equal footing with the big powers of the world.</li>
