         The International Bar Association (IBA) published a comprehensive Report on Global Regulation and Trade in Legal Services. It covers legal practice in 90 countries or over 160 jurisdictions in all of Europe and North America and part of the Middle-East, Central and South America, Africa and the Asia Pacific Region. This report is reproduced below for the country of Nigeria, as it gives a comprehensive insight into the legal profession in Nigeria.

        <div><h3><strong>Nigeria&#8217s Legal Profession</strong></h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
        <p><strong>Is there legislation governing the legal sector?</strong> Legal Practitioners Act 1962</p>
        <p><strong>Under what title do lawyers practise?</strong>Solicitor and advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria
        </p>
        <p><strong>How does an individual lawyer obtain a licence to practise law? How often must this be renewed?</strong>
        In order to become a Nigerian lawyer, an individual must obtain a Bachelorâ€™s degree in law (LL.B) from an accredited university, attend and pass the examination at the Nigerian Law School then subsequently be called to the Nigerian Bar by the Body of Benchers followed by enrolment at the Supreme Court of Nigeria as a Legal Practitioner. Admission into the Nigerian Law School is open to persons who hold an LL.B from an accredited Nigerian university or any other recognised university from other parts of the world. Once a person is called to the Nigerian Bar and enrolled in Roll of Legal Practitioners kept at the Nigerian Supreme Court, he\she is entitled to practise law in Nigeria without any further requirement. A practitioner is only required to register at a branch of the Nigerian Bar Association and pay practising fees to that branch. Practising fees are payable annually. Non-payment of practising fees may only disentitle the practitioner from audience in Nigerian courts. </p>

        <p><strong>Does this entitle the holder to practise throughout the country? </strong> Nigeria is a single jurisdiction and solicitors and advocates of the Supreme Court may practise throughout the country.</p>

        <p><strong>Are there certain activities that are &#145reserved&#146 for those who are licensed to practise law in the Nigeria?</strong> Only persons licensed to practise law in Nigeria can act as a legal practitioner in Nigeria. This includes all activities that are carried out by lawyers especially appearing in court as counsel on behalf of litigants and preparing, for a reward, drawing an instrument relating to immovable property, probate or letters of administration etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Do you need to hold local nationality to be eligible to practise law?</strong> No. A non-Nigerian may be eligible to practise law in Nigeria if he/she meets the requirements for enrolment as a legal practitioner</p>
<p><strong>What legal forms can lawyers work in? (eg, self-employment, partnership, limited liability partnership, multi-disciplinary partnership, incorporation)</strong> A lawyer can practise law in Nigeria as a sole practitioner or in a partnership and in a limited liability partnership (in some states such as Lagos State). A lawyer can practise law in a multi-disciplinary partnership. Such partnerships cannot, however, engage in the practice of law as a profession. For instance, a lawyer can be a partner in a consulting, financial advisory and tax advisory partnership but the partnership cannot carry on work as a firm of legal practitioners. A lawyer may be a legal adviser, company secretary or acquire other designations in a corporation. Such a lawyer can however not practice outside his employment and cannot appear in court as an advocate for the corporation.</p>

<p><strong>What other ethical or regulatory requirements must a licensed lawyer comply with?</strong> There are standard rules of professional conduct that lawyers licensed to practise law in Nigeria must comply with. They are embodied in the Rules of Professional Conduct, made pursuant to the Legal Practitioners&#8217 Act.</p>

<p><strong>Do law firms need to receive a licence (or permission/approval) to practise law?</strong> Law firms do not require any licence, permission or approval to practise law. However, there is a need to register as a business name at the Corporate Affairs Commission if any other word is added to the firm&#8217s name apart from the names of the practitioners.</p>

<p><strong>Which authority issues licences? Are there different authorities for individuals and firms? </strong> Only individuals require a licence &#151 in form of call to bar and enrolment &#151 to practise law in Nigeria. The licence is issued by the Body of Benchers. Firms operate as mere business names for legal practice by the individual lawyers and have no legal personality.</p>

<p><strong>Is Nigeria a member of the WTO?</strong> Nigeria joined the WTO on 1 January 1995.</p>

<p><strong>Has it made any WTO commitments on legal services?</strong> Nigeria has made no commitments in the WTO on legal services.</p>

<p><strong>Is Nigeria party to bilateral agreements that offer special treatment to businesses or individuals from particular countries? </strong> Nigeria is a member of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This agreement only covers trade in goods.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any foreign law firms present in this Nigeria?</strong> No. There are no foreign firms practising law in Nigeria.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any explicit rules or restrictions other than visas on fly-in, fly-out practice of law? Do you need to obtain a licence for temporary practise?</strong> Yes. A person can practise only in respect of certain proceedings for which he has been granted a warrant by the Chief Justice of Nigeria. To be entitled to such a warrant, the person must make an application to the Chief Justice showing that he is entitled to practise as an advocate in any country where the legal system is similar to that of Nigeria. If the Chief Justice is satisfied that it is expedient to permit such person to practice in Nigeria as an advocate for purposes of the particular proceedings applied for, the Chief Justice may grant such a warrant. See section 2(2) of the Legal Practitioners Act. 

There are no specific rules on fly-in-fly-out transactional work other than if that work falls under the definition of legal services, that person must be qualified to provide legal services in Nigeria.</p>

<p><strong>Can a foreign lawyer obtain a visa to visit clients or to market, even if they are not permitted to practise law?</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Can a foreign lawyer obtain a licence to establish and practise as a foreign legal consultant and what is the scope of this limited licence?</strong>
No. Concept of foreign legal consultant is not recognised in Nigeria. Anyone offering legal practice in Nigeria must be qualified and enrolled as a local practitioner.</p>

<p><strong>Are foreign lawyers permitted to undertake arbitration and mediation?</strong>There are no restrictions on arbitration and mediation on a fly-in, fly-out basis.</p>

<p><strong>Are foreign lawyers allowed to appear in court under any circumstances?</strong> Not generally. The only instance where this is possible is where a warrant has been issued to such foreign lawyer in respect of particular proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>Can foreign lawyers requalify as local lawyers?</strong> Yes. If he/she passes the qualifying bar exams administered by Nigerian Law School, produces a qualifying certificate to the Body of Benchers and satisfies the Benchers that he/she is of good character and is enrolled as a legal practitioner at the Supreme Court.</p>

<p><strong>Can a foreign law firm obtain a licence to open an office?</strong> No.</p>

<p><strong>May a domestic lawyer be employed by a foreign lawyer or law firm?</strong>A foreign lawyer or law firm cannot employ a Nigerian lawyer as a means of practising in Nigeria. A foreign lawyer or law firm can however engage a Nigerian lawyer to provide services as local counsel in respect of specific legal works.</p>

<p><stong>Can a domestic lawyer enter into partnership with a foreign lawyer?</stong> No, not for purposes of establishing a practice or presence in Nigeria.<p>

<p><strong>Can a domestic lawyer or domestic law firm employ a foreign lawyer?</strong> Yes, provided the foreign lawyer is qualified to practise law in Nigeria.</p>
