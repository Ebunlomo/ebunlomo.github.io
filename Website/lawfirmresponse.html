        </div>
        <p1>To further understand how globalisation is perceived by the legal profession in Nigeria, we emailed some law firms with a list of questions. We received answers from two of these firms and they help shed light on the state of globalisation as a concept in Nigeria</p1>

        <p>1. <strong>What are the challenges that exist for qualified lawyers in Africa to provide legal services in Europe, specifically in the United Kingdom? Are there greater challenges in establishing a law firm in the United Kingdom or practising as a qualified lawyer in the United Kingdom?</strong> The challenges that exist for qualified lawyers to provide legal services in Europe and specifically in the United Kingdom is that they do not or will not generally attract the best quality work.  Legal services are a professional service and at the lucrative end of the legal service spectrum, your ability to attract the right kind of work is dependent on the circles in which you mix and the people with whom you interact.  Racial prejudices will also play a part.  Thus, the majority of lawyers from Africa who now practice in the United Kingdom end up in the stereotypical areas of criminal law, immigration law and family law.  Very few get to do high quality commercial work or high quality international work because of the limitations imposed by their circle of influence.  </p>
        <p>2. <strong>Given that most recognisable African law firms specialise in oil and gas, what effect does that have on the ability and scope of Africa law firms to provide legal services globally?</strong>  I am not sure I agree with the statement that most recognisable African law firms specialise in oil and gas.  Having said this however, to the extent that an African law firm specialises in oil and gas, it does create more opportunity for the provision of legal services globally for a variety of reasons.  First, the majority of the exploration and production companies operating in Africa have their roots in the Northern hemisphere.  Thus, an African law firm servicing that industry is more likely than not, going to be interacting with global clients.  Also, African law firms that have developed a speciality in oil and gas are well placed to report this expertise to other African countries and other parts of the world where oil and gas form a mainstay of their economies. </p>
        <p>3.<strong> Do you think being a part of international bodies such as the East African Communities and African Union provide a platform to provide legal services globally?</strong>No I donâ€™t.</p>
        <p>4.<strong>Do you think globalisation has been to your benefit or detriment when it comes to the provision of legal services? </strong> I believe it has been both.  It has been to my benefit as it has brought a significant number of skills and practices closer to home than they would otherwise have been and has contributed in significant measure to the improvement of our practice standards.  It has been to my detriment in the sense that a substantial amount of work that I could be doing has been and continues to be farmed out to international law firms as a result of globalisation and the ever-extending reach of the ILFs.</p>

     <p>1.<strong>What are the challenges that exist for qualified lawyers in Africa to provide legal services in Europe, specifically in the United Kingdom? Are there greater challenges in establishing a law firm in the United Kingdom or practising as a qualified lawyer in the United Kingdom? </strong>I do not practice in the UK but I am qualified to practice and indeed has been admitted to the bar in Ontario, Canada. If my experience in Canada is anything to go by, I am of the view that cultural barriers exist in the practice of law by Africans who have emigrated to Europe and North America. Much of the problems facing from lawyers from the colonies in the metropolitan bars of Europe and North America stem from cultural differences. For example, book keeping and formality are virtually alien to a lot of African-born lawyers especially those who practised in less stringent circumstances. Second, clientele and sourcing of jobs are largely dependent on social networks. Immigrants and immigrant lawyers from Africa naturally have a tougher time developing a clientele base in Europe and/or North America.</p>

     <p>2. <strong>Given that most recognisable African law firms specialise in oil and gas, what effect does that have on the ability and scope of Africa law firms to provide legal services globally?</strong> I disagree with the premise of your question. Only a handful of African countries produce oil and gas. In fact, the largest and most recognizable law firms in Africa, eg, Adams & Adams, are based in South Africa. More than 60% of briefs from Europe to African countries pass through South African law firms. The bulk of the work is in IPRs, services such as hospitality, mining, franchising. These are areas of practice already dominated by European and North American law firms. It is no secret that White-owned law firms dominate the landscape of legal practice in Africa.</p>

     <p>3. <strong>Do you think being a part of international bodies such as the East African Communities and African Union provide a platform to provide legal services globally? </strong> No. These bodies have little or no capacity to influence changes in that sphere.</p>
       
     <p>4.<strong>Do you think globalisation has been to your benefit or detriment when it comes to the provision of legal services? [Dr. Ikechi]</strong> As I had argued elsewhere (see, Ikechi Mgbeoji, The Comprador Complex), since the colonial encounter, legal practice has always been globalized. The local lawyers imbibe the habits, values, temperaments, and world-beliefs of the major clients. The more lucrative the area of practice, the greater likelihood of the local lawyer embracing the structure of clientelism.</p>
